# CLIP-Debiasing
This is the code for my MSAI thesis! 

To debias models on your own, you will need to download both FairFace and Balanced Faces in the Wild datasets.

Those can be found here:
Balanced Faces in the Wild: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/balanced-faces-wild
FairFace: https://github.com/joojs/fairface

More information will be added with how to run these files in the next few weeks.
